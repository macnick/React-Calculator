### Objective

The objective of this project is to build a simple turn-based RPG game with a scoring system, using JavaScript ES6, Phaser 3 framework, and other modern technologies. See [technologies used](#Technologies-Used) for more info. I had to design the story, the gameplay, the scenes, and the scoring system.

### Live version

The game is hosted on two different servers, macexperts.gr and netlify.com. Both use the same API to store the scores so it does not matter in which one you play. You can play the game here:

- [**Dark Forest**](https://darkforest.netlify.app) @ netlify
- [**Dark Forest**](https://macexperts.gr/darkforest) @ macexperts
